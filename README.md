# Random-File-Picker
Wanted to open random mp3 files. Based on a Stack Overflow Comment. Made in Jan. 2022
- V.1 Notes: It open any random File inside a folder, but not in the subfolders of chosen folder. Typing folder location with quotations causes an error. not case sensitive, does not diferentiate between '/' and '\\'
- V.2 Change Notes: Typing folder with quotes, or straight copy pasting from Explorer.exe is now fine, it no longer causes causes an error.
- V.2 Folder with EXE Notes: Compiled using pyinstaller, requires entire folder. Mildly tested on PC it was made on. Made 03:53 2022.01.28
- V.2.1 Change Notes: Fixed error with directory changing. Exe version mildly tested on PC it was made on. Made 2022.01.28 04:00

- Been using V.2.1 for 4 hours. No errors so far, Some songs repeat occasionally, but that is because it is true random.
- Tested V.2.1 on 3 other computers that run windows, and don't have python installed. Program worked on both windows 10 machines, but not windows 7.
