# Random-File-Picker
Wanted to open random mp3 files. Based on a Stack Overflow Comment. Made in Jan. 2022
- V.1 Notes: It open any random File inside a folder, but not in the subfolders of chosen folder. Typing folder location with quotations causes an error. not case sensitive, does not diferentiate between '/' and '\\'
- V.2 Change Notes: Typing folder with quotes, or straight copy pasting from Explorer.exe is now fine, it no longer causes causes an error.
- V.2 Folder with EXE Notes: Compiled using pyinstaller, requires entire folder. Mildly tested on PC it was made on. Made 03:53 2022.01.28
